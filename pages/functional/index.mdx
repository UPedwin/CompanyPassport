  Introduction

The CompanyPassport trust framework aims to address a range of use cases that can benefit from the exchange of verifiable “organizational attestations”. From “know your business” to security and privacy certifications, ESG reporting, Digital Product Passports (DPP) and international trade documents. However, to limit the scope, the CompanyPassport Architecture WG is focussing on an initial single use case.

This initial use case is the founding of a new “Besloten Vennootschap” (BV), a Dutch private limited liability company (Ltd.). This use case acts as an example of a process that involves the exchange of company data between a range of stakeholders, the company and its founders and employees. The objective is to provide a generic trust framework and architecture that can also be applied to other use cases and with different credentials and stakeholders. During the course of the project additional use cases may be added.
